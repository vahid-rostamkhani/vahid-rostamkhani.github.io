I am a Ph.D. candidate in Finance at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE). My research focuses on empirical asset pricing, with a particular interest in currency markets, factor models, and the macroeconomic drivers of risk premia.

I combine my academic work with practical experience, having recently worked as a Quantitative Research Intern at Fidelity Investments in the Multi-Asset Systematic team, where I contributed to the development of FX strategies and the team's Python-based research infrastructure.

## Research

My current research investigates the sources of risk and return in financial markets. My working papers explore the macroeconomic foundations of currency risk premia and the role of bankruptcy risk in the cross-section of equity returns.

* **Currency Risk Premia and (Many) Fundamentals Connected in the Long-Run**
    * [Link to paper on SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5349012)
    * In this paper, I study the macroeconomic foundations of currency risk premia using a unique annual dataset from 1926-2023. I find that the predictability of currency returns comes primarily from exploiting relative macroeconomic differences across countries (a cross-sectional channel) rather than timing the U.S. dollar. The analysis shows that a robust pricing model should aggregate information from many fundamental signals, as no single factor provides a complete explanation.

* **Recoverable Equity**
    * [Link to paper on SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5349016)
    * This paper demonstrates that equity holders demand higher returns from firms where a greater portion of investment value is expected to be lost in the event of bankruptcy. I show a robust inverse relationship between a firm's equity recovery rate and its subsequent risk-adjusted returns. This premium is distinct from well-known premiums related to financial leverage and distress risk.

I am passionate about applying rigorous quantitative methods to understand markets in general. Please feel free to get in touch if you would like to discuss my research.
